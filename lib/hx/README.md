# hx

hx is a static library that extends the standard library of C, offering safer,
more performant alternatives to its functionalities or new capabilities to
instances of types built into the language.

Each API added to this library **must** be tested thoroughly, as its usage is
encouraged and enforced over equivalent C functionalities throughout the entire
Helena project.
